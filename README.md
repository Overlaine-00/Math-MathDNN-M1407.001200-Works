# Mathematical Foundation of Deep Neural Network (MathDNN)
This is a homework of lecture MathDNN in SNU.  
This class covers followings:
- Notion of neural network
- optimizers, backprop
- MLP, CNN
- Data augmentation, regularization techniques
- Flow model
- Variational autoencoder, GAN
- Concrete examples (not mainly) : LeNet, NiN network, GoogLeNet, ResNet, SENet, DenseNet, and so on
